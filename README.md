# 🌟 Celo Hackathon: AgentVault + SplitBot

### [ Winning Material ] - The Full Agentic Stack for Celo
This project doesn't just build a bot; it implements the **complete decentralized agent infrastructure** required for the next generation of on-chain economy.

- **🆔 Official Identity (ERC-8004)**: SplitBot is an officially registered Celo Agent (**Agent #222**). It owns an on-chain NFT identity, enabling discovery and trust across the global agent mesh.
- **👮 Autonomous Slashing (Enforcement)**: Unlike traditional bots, this agent can enforce its own financial logic. If a user defaults on a payment calculated by the AI, the agent can autonomously "slash" their on-chain deposit via `TripEscrow.sol`.
- **🌐 Agent Mesh (libp2p)**: Features a built-in P2P communication layer. The agent "gossips" with other nodes in a decentralized mesh, ensuring coordination even without central servers.
- **🛡️ Multimodal Enclave (Lit TEE)**: Financial settlements are signed via **Threshold Cryptography** inside a Lit Protocol Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). The agent's private key never exists in one place, making it trustless and leak-proof.

## 🚀 Project Overview

1.  **AgentVault (Infrastructure)**: A persistent, encrypted memory service. Uses IPFS for storage, Lit Protocol for access control, and Thirdweb x402 for micropayment barriers.
2.  **SplitBot (Application)**: A multimodal Telegram agent that manages trip expenses using **Gemini 1.5 Flash** for voice/text parsing and on-chain debt settlement.

## 📜 Smart Contracts

The `TripEscrow.sol` contract manages group funds with integrated agent permissions.

| Contract | Network | Address / Identity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TripEscrow** | 🟢 Celo Sepolia | [`0x79cB34E300D37f3B65852338Ac1f3a0C1ED6Ca29`](https://sepolia.celoscan.io/address/0x79cB34E300D37f3B65852338Ac1f3a0C1ED6Ca29) |
| **TripEscrow** | 🔵 Celo Mainnet | [`0xD43Bb3a001Ff360e28051d27363f8967E4a4C147`](https://celoscan.io/address/0xD43Bb3a001Ff360e28051d27363f8967E4a4C147) |
| **Agent Identity** | 🆔 [AgentScan](https://testnet.8004scan.io/agents/celo-sepolia/222) | **Official Agent ID #222** (ERC-8004 Mainnet) |

### 🆔 ERC-8004: Agent Trust & Reputation
SplitBot follows the **ERC-8004** standard for decentralized AI agents. This protocol enables our agent to:
- **Universal Discovery**: Using its portable NFT identity (**Agent #3549**), other agents on Celo can discover and interact with SplitBot's endpoints.
- **On-Chain Reputation**: Every successfully settled trip contributes to a verifiable "starred" reputation on the Celo blockchain, making the agent's reliability transparent to the entire ecosystem.
- **Trustless Identity**: The agent's identity is cryptographically linked to its wallet, allowing for secure threshold signing via Lit Protocol.

### Key Features:
- **Autonomous Slashing**: The agent can seize portions of deposits if members fail to fulfill AI-calculated settlement requests.
- **AI Settlement Oracle**: SplitBot acts as an off-chain oracle using secure signatures.
- **Anti-Drain Caps**: 500 USDC daily settlement limit to prevent total loss in case of logic exploits.

### 📜 Smart Contract Architecture

The `TripEscrow.sol` contract serves as the decentralized settlement layer for all group financial interactions. It acts as a non-custodial vault where funds are managed by the **SplitBot Agent's** verifiable logic.

### High-Level Logic Overview:
- **Trustless P2P Settlement**: Users deposit USDC into the vault. The agent uses AI to parse conversational debt and generates **Lit TEE session signatures** to authorize payouts directly to creditors, bypassing manual bank transfers.
- **Autonomous Slashing (Game Theory Enforcement)**: If the group agrees on a debt but a member refuses to pay, the Agent can invoke `slashUser()`. This moves the offender's deposit into the collective pool for redistribution, programmatically enforcing social contracts.
- **Safe-Stop Mechanics**:
    - **Anti-Drain Cap**: A hardcoded limit prevents the Agent from settling more than **500 USDC per day**, protecting the group from logic bugs or unauthorized drenches.
    - **Pausability**: The contract owner can instantly freeze all operations in case of a suspected emergency.
- **ERC-8004 Identity**: The contract only accepts commands from the verified **SplitBot Agent Identity (#222)**, ensuring that only the decentralized node with the correct TEE credentials can move money.

### ✈️ Real-World Scenario: The "Bali Trip" 🥥

Imagine three friends—**Alice, Bob, and Charlie**—on a 3-day trip to Bali.

1.  **Trustless Deposit**: Each friend deposits **100 USDC** into the `TripEscrow` at the start of the trip. The pool now contains **300 USDC**.
2.  **Conversational Logging**:
    *   Alice pays **$150** for the Airbnb and sends a voice note: *"Hey SplitBot, Airbnb was $150."*
    *   The Agent calculates that each person's share is $50. Since Alice already paid $150, the group owes her $100.
3.  **Autonomous Settlement**:
    *   Alice triggers `/settle`.
    *   The Agent, running inside a **Lit Enclave**, verifies the debts and calls `settleExpense(Alice, 100 USDC)`.
    *   **Alice is instantly reimbursed** $100 from the escrow pool. Her net spend is now exactly her fair share ($50).
4.  **The Penalty (Game Theory in Action)**:
    *   If Bob refuses to confirm his registry or "ghosts" the group, the Agent can **slash** Bob’s initial $100 deposit to cover the group's missing liquidity, ensuring the trip stays funded and fair.

## ⚙️ Operational Modes

SplitBot is designed to be flexible for different group trust levels. It supports two distinct settlement strategies:

1.  **Direct P2P Settlement (Demo Mode)**: 
    *   **Mechanism**: The Agent calculates the debts and generates a **MiniPay/Valora Deep Link** for each debtor. 
    *   **Flow**: Users click the link in Telegram to initiate a direct peer-to-peer USDC transfer.
    *   **Best for**: Casual groups with high social trust.

2.  **Trustless Escrow Pooling (Hardcore Mode)**:
    *   **Mechanism**: Users deposit USDC into the `TripEscrow.sol` contract upfront.
    *   **Flow**: The Agent autonomously calls `settleExpense()` via **Lit Protocol TEE** to reimburse creditors from the pool.
    *   **Best for**: Global hackathon teams or groups requiring algorithmic enforcement and **Slashing** protection.

## 🏆 Reputation & Credit Score

SplitBot doesn't just log numbers; it builds a **Verifiable Reputation Score** for every user. 

- **Settlement Health**: The Agent tracks the time-to-settle for every debt. Frequent on-time payers gain high reputation badges.
- **Default Protection**: If a user is **Slashed** in Escrow Mode, their reputation score is permanently downgraded in the Agent's global memory.
- **ERC-8004 Integration**: Future versions will allow users to query an Agent's reputation score before joining a group, creating a decentralized trust layer for the "Real World" economy.

## 🧠 Deep Dive: AgentVault Module

**AgentVault** is the "Persistent Brain" of the SplitBot. It ensures the Agent has perfect memory across restarts while maintaining absolute privacy.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Working:

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Privacy** | **Lit Protocol (TEE)** | Encrypts the Agent's state (Transactions/Registry) using Threshold Cryptography. Only the Agent's logic can see the plain text. |
| **Storage** | **Pinata / IPFS** | Provides a decentralized, immutable home for the encrypted memory. |
| **Economic Barrier** | **Thirdweb x402** | Implements a tiny micropayment (USDC) for every "Memory Save" to prevent spam and fund the Agent's operations. |
| **AI Processing** | **Gemini 1.5 Flash** | Interrogates the recovered memory to provide conversational responses and dynamic balance tracking. |

**The Workflow**: 
1. `Bot Saves State` $\rightarrow$ 2. `Lit Action Encrypts String` $\rightarrow$ 3. `Thirdweb x402 Micropayment` $\rightarrow$ 4. `Pinata Pins JSON` $\rightarrow$ 5. `CID Returned`.

## Lit Chipotle (Base) vs Celo Sepolia (app chain)

[Chipotle’s architecture](https://docs.dev.litprotocol.com/) shows **on-chain control-plane contracts on Base** (e.g. PKP registry, API key registry, groups). That is **where Lit registers PKPs, API keys, and action groups**—not where this app holds user funds.

| Layer | Chain | Role |
| ----- | ----- | ---- |
| **Chipotle / Lit control plane** | **Base** (per Lit docs) | Register PKP, usage API key, groups, attach pinned Lit Action CIDs |
| **SplitBot settlement** | **Celo Sepolia** (`11142220`) | `TripEscrow`, USDC, ERC-8004 |

The Lit Action (`packages/agent-vault/src/lit-actions/settleTrip.js`) calls `Lit.Actions.signEthers` with **`chainId: 11142220`** so the threshold signature targets **Celo Sepolia**—consistent with `TripEscrow` on Celo. **You do not deploy Chipotle’s Base contracts yourself;** you use Lit’s hosted services and dashboard on Base while settling on Celo.

**Checklist**

1. In **Lit Dev / Chipotle**: create PKP, scoped **usage** API key (`LIT_CHIPOTLE_API_KEY`), group, and register the Lit Action CID (`LIT_SETTLEMENT_IPFS_CID`) as documented—this flow uses Lit’s **Base**-deployed registries.
2. Ensure the PKP / policy allows signing for **Celo Sepolia** if your Lit dashboard has per-chain allowlists.
3. **`LIT_NETWORK=naga-dev`** controls which **Lit validator network** the SDK connects to (TEE mesh)—separate from Base RPC or Celo RPC.
4. If the SDK logs **`fetch failed`** to Lit validator URLs, that is **connectivity to Lit nodes** (VPN/firewall/status), not “Celo missing from Chipotle docs.”
